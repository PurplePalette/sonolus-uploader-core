# Sonolus uploader core (backend for sonolus)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/PurplePalette/sonolus-uploader-core)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/PurplePalette/sonolus-uploader-core)

First public [Sonolus](https://sonolus.com/) api to manage user generated background, effect, engine, level, particle and skin. Sure it accepts user upload and, able to deliver the contents to sonolus client.

## Running Requirements
- Firebase firestore
  - This api uses it as database backend.
- Firebase Authorization
  - This api depends it to verify the user.
- Memory
  - This api caches the whole firestore data in memory.
  - I recommend bigger memory, if you try to make big community.
- Frontend
  - This api does not have method to
  - You can use [sonolus-uploader](https://github.com/PurplePalette/sonolus-uploader) or make your own frontend.

## Building requirements
- Go 1.15.6 or higher is required.

## Objectives
Some sonolus community uses static files to deliver their sonolus contents.
It has risk to break whole db by conflict or typo when changing, and also hard to add new contents.
With this api and frontend, they don't need to care to make breaking change anymore.
